			<h1>Minecraft Structure Analyzer</h1>

			<p>Welcome! In this page you can "analyze" your minecraft structures so you can know things like exactly how many blocks there are of each kind.</p>
			<p>When you save a structure in your minecraft world with the structure block it's saved in your world folder under generated/minecraft/structures with the format ".nbt".<br>Structure files are gzip compressed, which means that just reading the .nbt yields basically non-sense.<br>Right now, this page doesn't uncompress your file, so you'll have to do it.<br>Just use WinRAR or your program of choice to open the .nbt file and extract the only file it has, which shouldn't have a format. <b>This is the file you should upload</b>.</p>
			<p>As of right now, this page is barely functional. I made it partly for programming self-teaching, so don't expect much. Rather, expect bugs.<br>I'm planning on adding more stuff, but right now the page will tell you about your structure size and how many blocks you need to build it.</p>
			<p>If you want to know more about how structures are saved, I've included a hex dump for all of us nerds to look at.<br>(though it works horribly slow and you should use other tools to take a look at your file's hex dump)<br><a href="https://wiki.vg/NBT" target="_blank">Here</a> is a good wiki page about the NBT format and <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Structure_block_file_format" target="_blank">here</a> is another specifically about structure files.</p>
			<p>Source code available at <a href="https://github.com/Diegox6/MC-Structure-Analyzer" target="_blank">Github</a> - <a href="..">Back to my main page</a></p>
